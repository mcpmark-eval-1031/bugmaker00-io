I am a first-year PhD candidate at HKUST NLP Group, supervised by Professor Junxian He. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, with particular interests in LLM Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning, Hallucination in Vision-Language Models, and LLM truthfulness and Interpretability.

I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in June 2024 with a B.Eng. degree. I have worked as a Research Intern at MINIMAX (Feb 2025 - Present), Tencent WXG (June 2024 - Sept 2024), and Shanghai AI Lab (June 2023 - Dec 2023). I have published papers at top conferences including EMNLP, ICML, and NeurIPS.

This website showcases my academic work, including publications, talks, teaching experience, and projects.
